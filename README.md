# Johnny's dotfiles

My dotfiles for easily getting up to speed on a new machine.

Not complete as of yet, but the framework is in place.

## Install

Run:

```
git clone https://github.com/joch/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install.sh
```

## TODO

* Add all currently missing dotfiles
* Mechanism for load external private files
